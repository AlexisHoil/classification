### 1.Explain why a developer, who is good at both low-level and high level programing languages, woul normally use a high level language when writing programs?
I think that developers use a high-level language because is easier to understand or another person can understand what he makes, also it can be used on variety of diferent machines. Furthermore it has some features that in low level languages have not available like selection and iteration constructs, Boolean operators or identifiers.

### 1.Describe three differences between low-level language and high-level languages?
| High-level language | Low-level language |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| It is programmer friendly language, It is easy to understand, It need compiler or interpreter for translation | It is a machine friendly language, It is tough to understand, It needs assembler for translation |
 
### 2. What does a translator do?
Translate the high-level language and assembler languages into machine code for a computer system understan it.

### 3. Identify two types of translators that can turn high-level languages into machine code?
Interpreters and compilers
